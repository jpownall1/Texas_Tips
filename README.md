# Texas_Tips
First project - Texas Tips is a visual aid for people who don't have a good understanding of Texas Holdem Poker hands.

The program takes the input of the cards in the game, the 2 cards in your hand and 1-5 cards on the table at the time.

This will return the best possible hand a player has at that point in the game.
